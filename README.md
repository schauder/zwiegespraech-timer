# Zwiegespräch-Timer
A timer for "Zwiegespräche" and a playground to fool around with web technology.

You can find the current version here http://schauder.github.io/zwiegespraech-timer/

## What the heck is a "Zwiegespräch"

It is a structured form of dialogue in which the participants take turns speaking for 15 minutes until each spoke 3 times.
In this time the other dialogue partner remains silent and does not react to what is said.
Contributions should focus on one self and ones feelings and experiences.

It sounds weired, but it is a great tool. 
You should try it. 
For more information see https://www.wielandstolzenburg.de/zwiegespraeche/ (German).

## Why do I need a special timer for this?

You don't. Especially not this one, which is horrible bad. 
I'm not a Web of JavaScript developer and you can tell from the result.
But maybe I made you aware of the idea of "Zwiegespräch".
If so I considere the project a success.
